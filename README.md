# INTELLIGENT-CHATBOT-FOR-BETTER-BANKING-EXPERIENCES
In this project report, we examine how to make a self-learning chatbot utilizing
IBM Watson as an AI Engine. We start by presenting IBM Watson and putting it with
regards to self-learning chatbots. Self-learning implies that it needn't bother with
outside help with regards to preparing the framework. The framework is intended for
banks to utilize where clients can ask any bank-related queries like loan, account, add
beneficiary, and so on which are bank-related questions. This framework is produced
for gadgets that have web availability.
The framework perceives the client's query and comprehends what he/she needs to pass
on and all the while answers them suitably. As of now, there are chat applications for
banks. The queries posed by the clients can be in any configuration. There is no
particular format for clients to pose queries. The implicit artificial intelligence
framework understands clients' necessities and gives reasonable responses to the client.
We outline what the issues with chatbots are and how to tackle those issues by making
them more astute by offering great client encounters. We will talk about various types
of services IBM Watson furnishes to make a chatbot with learning abilities. Further, we
depict how designers can begin with making an IBM Watson chatbot effectively and
productively.
